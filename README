Liberate your Desktop and push i3 to its limits!
GPLv3

Version: 0.9.1b

---- Before you do anything ----
  I'm using nulli3 at 2560x1440 resolution so things might seem
  a little magnified at lower resolutions. At this moment I'm
  using the config.mate, which means I'm going to focus on the i3/mate
  version. However since i3 is extremely simple feel free to hack it
  for your own needs (Don't forget to take a look at "nulli3/scripts/"
  folder too).
  After all, All that I'm offering is just a config and a couple of
  scripts, Nothing more, Nothing less.

---- Install the nulli3 Desktop ----
  * Link (ln -s) or copy ./nulli3 to ~/.i3
  * If you're paranoid:
  # cat ~/.i3/scripts/install.sh
  * Finally:
  # sh ~/.i3/scripts/install.sh

---- Post Installation ----
  * You may want to set your default programs under the
    "Default Programs" part at "DEFINE" section inside "config" file.

  * You can change i3 coloring profile by uncommenting color schemes
    at "COLORSET" section, uncommenting the entire "COLORS" section
    and finally uncommenting the "Workspace Colors" part of the "BAR" section.

  * If you want to add program to your startup do it from
    "System Settings" (bindkey= MCc) or add it at the bottom of the ".i3/config" file
    you're currently using.

  * Take a look at "STARTUP" and "The Last Part" sections at
    the end of ".i3/config" or ".i3/config.mate" file, you may want to change them
    to suit your needs.

---- FAQ ----
0. How can I log in?!
    Log out and log into "MATE" or "nulli3: mate"

1. How can I set a wallpaper?
    You can change it in your "Control Center".
	Note: Use "nitrogen" in the startx mode.

2. How can I change status bar?
    Just edit ".i3/scripts/status.sh" or ".i3/scripts/status-mate.sh".

3. Is it possible to change my desktop theme?
    Of course!
    a) Do it in your control center (MCc)
    b) GTK: Hit ME (or Md) then type "gtk-chtheme" and hit "Enter", now change
        your gtk theme.

4. How can I prevent caja from showing desktop in Mate?
   nulli3 will do it automatically for you AFTER the first run. You can also do
   it yourself by using mate-tweak and check the "disable show desktop icons".

5. Notifications are shown unthemed
   Try these:
   # sudo apt-get purge dunst
   # killall -9 dunst
   # notify-send "Hello"
   If these doesn't fixed it try
   # sudo apt-get remove notification-daemon
   # sudo dpkg-reconfigure notify-osd

 6. Custom resolution:
   Device name:
   # xrandr | grep -e " connected [^(]" | sed -e "s/\([A-Z0-9]\+\) connected.*/\1/"
   Generate command line:
   # cvt <Height> <Width> <Freq.>
   New mode:
   # sudo xrandr --newmode <CVT Command>
   Apply:
   # sudo xrandr --addmode <Device Name> <Config Name>
   Make it permanent:
   # sudo nano /etc/X11/Xsession.d/45custom_xrandr
   # xrandr --newmode <CVT Command>
   # xrandr --addmode <Device Name> <Config Name>

   Example:
   # cvt 2304 1296 60
   # sudo xrandr --newmode "2304x1296_60.00"  251.25  2304 2464 2712 3120  1296 1299 1304 1344 -hsync +vsync
   # sudo xrandr --addmode eDP-1 2304x1296_60.00
