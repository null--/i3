  * You can change i3 coloring profile by uncommenting color schemes at "COLORSET" section, uncommenting entire "COLORS" section
    and finally uncommenting "Workspace Colors" part of "BAR" section.
  * If you want to add program to your startup do it from "Cinnamon Settings" (bindkey= MCc).
  * Take a look at "STARTUP" and "The Last Part" sections at the end of "config" file, you may want to change them
    to suit your needs.
