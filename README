---- Post Installatoin ----
  * You may want to set your default programs under the 
    "Default Programs" part at "DEFINE" section inside "config" file.
    
  * You can change i3 coloring profile by uncommenting color schemes 
    at "COLORSET" section, uncommenting the entire "COLORS" section
    and finally uncommenting the "Workspace Colors" part of the "BAR" section.
    
  * If you want to add program to your startup do it from 
    "Cinnamon Settings" (bindkey= MCc).
    
  * Take a look at "STARTUP" and "The Last Part" sections at 
    the end of "config" or "config.pure" file, you may want to change them
    to suit your needs.

---- FAQ ----
0. How can I log in?!
    Log out and before logging in select "nulli3: pure" or
    "nulli3: cinnamon" as your desktop. (I prefer the pure one!)
    
1. How can I set a wallpaper?
    Use "nitrogen" (Press Md then type "nitrogen" and hit "Enter").

2. How can I change status bar?
    Just edit status.sh!
        
3. Is it possible to change my desktop theme?
    Of course!
    a) Cinnamon: Hit MCc then choose "Theme" and change your cinnamon theme
        under "Othe Settings".
    b) GTK: Hit Md (or ME) then type "gtk-chtheme" and hit "Enter", now change 
        your gtk theme. 

4. How to change keyboard layout?
   You can either use "Cinnamon Control Center (MCc) > Keyboard" or R-Click
   on gxneur (the "US" flag on tray bar) and choose preferences.

5. Disable desktop in MATE: use mate-tweak and disabe show desktop icons
