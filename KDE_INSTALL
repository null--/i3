copy contents of this folder to ~/i3
copy i3-kde to /usr/bin/i3-kde
then
	chmod 755 /usr/bin/i3-kde

create this file:
	/usr/share/kde4/apps/ksmserver/windowmanagers/i3.desktop

and copy-pate the following text into it:
	[Desktop Entry]
	Encoding=UTF-8 
	Name=i3
	Comment=Highly configurable framework window manager 
	Type=Application
	Exec=i3-kde
	TryExec=i3

now, you should be able to choose i3 as your window manager for KDE in
	System Settings-Default Applications->Window Manager

ENJOY!
